A quick disclaimer before we begin:
I've written this peace (on an iPhone, nota bene!) back in September of
2017, probably after a few beers.
I've chosen not to modify it too much before posting here.

By now (June of 2018) I'm still a happy iPhone SE owner and iCloud user,
I also use a MacBook Pro for work.

Alright, let's get on with it.

By buying into Apple services (music, cloud storage, messages...)
you are pretty much forcing yourself into getting Apple hardware for
your computing needs. This has a side effect of
[freeing your mind](https://media.giphy.com/media/wc0SKce7o5jvW/giphy.gif).

Yeah, you could get a Windows laptop that would be suitable for games
and work and movies and photo editing. Sure, you could get this shiny
new Android phone that would take decent photos, allow you to text/call
your friends and play your favorite music just fine. Those alternatives
would probably be cheaper too!

But you won’t get that new Acer laptop; you won’t buy that shiny LG phone. 

You’ve already invested in 200GB of iCloud storage. You’ve already
converted your parents to iMessage. You’ve already given your old
iPhone to your spouse, with all its apps shared though Apple’s Family Sharing. 

And that’s OK.

Apple products are much more expensive that what you could get elsewhere
from other vendors, but I would still say you save both a bit of money
AND a peace of mind in the long run. 

Let’s tackle the money side first. 

Your new iPhone will probably last at least 3-4 years until it stops
being supported by software updates. Speaking of which, you are gonna 
eceive new software and security updates instantly, and updating is easy
enough for your
[whole family to do](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/).
Your iOS/macOS devices are gonna hold their value well, should you chose
to resell them. Due to tight integration of hardware and software you
are gonna encounter technical issues much less often than in
Android/Windows world.
Once you do encounter them - you can count on dozens upon dozens of people
on the interwebs with the exact same issue on the exact same hardware
figuring it out before you. You can rely on somewhat competent technical
advice in most shopping malls in the world, as certified Apple resellers
are pretty much required by now to have a ‘hip’ shopping center.

On to the peace of mind argument now.

Basically, if you know your next phone is going to be an iPhone, you can
only care about the new iPhones. I am a huge gear head myself; I constantly
worry if I have the newest, bestest gear for the job. I stress over whether
the LG V30 is better than the Samsung S8 or no; which one is more worth
to spend my money on. Once I took the leap of faith and invested heavily
into Apple ecosystem - all that stress and anxiety goes away.
I know that I will upgrade to the next iPhone a few years down the road.
I know that it’s gonna be good, as every iPhone before it has been
(assuming you’re
[holding it right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4#Antenna).
I know that I can invest in cool App Store applications as I will be able
to use them on my next laptop, as it’s gonna be a MacBook.

Worrying about all this stuff is a big part of my self, that I can
completely let go, once I
[go full Apple](https://media.giphy.com/media/gWaKXZ1X8rHOM/giphy.gif).
That gives me more time and energy to focus on stuff that matters.

And, I reckon, that’s what minimalist altitude is all about.
