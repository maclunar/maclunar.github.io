Hello!

I've figured I'm gonna do my blog the proper way - with [Jekyll][jekyll].
That's what developers are supposed to use nowadays, right?

So what's gonna appear here? Movie reviews, that's for sure. I'm also hoping
to turn a section of this app into my photography portfolio somehow, thought
my [tumblr][tumblr-photography] works quite well for now.

The whole thing will probably be put together using [neo-vim][neo-vim] and -
my latest discovery - the [Firefox Developer Edition][firefox]. It's got
awesome compability mode that can simulate mobile devices and sexy
dark-themed developer tools. Plus it's cutting edge. I implore you to check
it out and not give in to Chrome's monopoly.

[Power to the people, stick it to the man!][captain-fantastic]

Alright, enough wiht my rambling for now. Stay strong, friends!
