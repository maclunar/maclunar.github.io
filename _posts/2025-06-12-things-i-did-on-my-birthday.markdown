Yesterday was my 35th birthday.

Here is a list of things I did and enjoyed, in no particular order:

* drove my car to a nearby town and back
* went rock climbing and the gym was almost empty
* played some Death Stranding, and this sly devil Kojima had some surprises for me:
	* there was a happy birthday cake in the private room
	* Mads Mikkelsen wished me a happy birthday!
* took my dog for a walk
* rode my fixed gear bike to the shop
* had some coffee, which I made in a moka pot
* ate delicious pistachio-filled croissant
* did some basic woodworking: cut an OSB board down and used it to mount a hangboard above a doorframe
* talked with my parents on the phone
* played some some Mario Kart with my wife
* watched a silly-but-fun movie (The Fountain of Youth, 3/5)
* watched a bit of Rouge One (fresh off Andor season 2) while sipping a nice rum (Sailor Jerry)
* caught up on my language lessons

Simple pleasures. A great day.
