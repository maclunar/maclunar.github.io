Yo!

What I'm gonna do now is post a list of things I'd like to do with
this space:

* customize the theme to look awesome,
* share insight about my setup and workflow,
* copy over movie reviews from tumblr (tumblr is gonna be for
photography only),
* figure out if this jekyll blog can serve as a photography
portfolio as well,
* integrate disqus?

I also wonder if the updates are gonna be daily from now on?
What's up with that, eh?
