i'm in krak√≥w, poland. the summer is raging, weather is awesome.

i've been working at infakt for well over a year now.
i've learned a lot and met fantastic people, but i am yearning to
go back to working remotely. i'd love to travel more.

stil not eating meet and it's going great.
if you've ever considered going this road
-- i can wholeheartedly recommend watching some of
[earthling ed's videos](https://hooktube.com/channel/UCVRrGAcUc7cblUzOhI1KfFg){:target='_blank'}.

i'm trying to stay active. i'm riding my bike a lot, commuting to
work almost daily. for the past year i've also owned my first
motorbike -- an old yamaha xj600n -- so i'm taking that when i'm
feeling more lazy.

i've switched my text editor of choice to
[spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org){:target='_blank'}. i love it so far - it's very
intuitive and discoverable. check out
[my configuration](https://gist.github.com/maclunar/7f5a7dd63e38081342b596b618c8d629){:target='_blank'}
if you're interested.

the dog is doing great. he's healthy and over 4 at this point.
he also doesn't eat meat.

i should be running more...
