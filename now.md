I'm in Krak√≥w, Poland. It's almost summer time.

Almost a month ago I've started a new job in a local company,
working as a ruby on rails developer on an in-house project.
It's a big change after working remotely for a software house,
but so far I'm really enjoying it.

I haven't eaten any meat for almost a year now.
I feel healthy and i'm positive i can keep this up for the
rest of my life. If you've ever considered going this road
-- i can wholeheartedly recommend watching some of 
[Earthling Ed's videos][ed].

Feeling a bit bored with Vim (gasp!), I'm experimenting with
VS Code at the moment. It's nice to use something else for
a little while. The mouse integration in this thing is really
impressive! Also, it looks great with solarized-light theme.

The dog is doing great. He's healthy and over 3 at this point.
He also doesn't eat meat.

I need to fix my bike.
