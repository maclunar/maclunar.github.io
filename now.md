february 2020, koh samui, thailand

we did it!
me and my wife escaped polish winter and we're enjoying the sun and the warmth of thai
weather in january and february (and a tiny bit of march).

we were staying in chiang mai for a month, then we took a week off to travel around, and now
we're in koh samui.

this big change was made possible by us finding work at remote-first companies.
time difference to our teams back in europe is around +6 hours, which is proving to be
completely manageable.

of course we miss our families and our dog, but we love thailand - it's our second time here.

taking this long trip was a good excuse for me to get a new - proper - camera. i used to
shoot exclusively with ricoh gr (1st gen) for the past year or so, but i missed this
hands on, involved feel one gets from a bigger camera and lens. anyway, to make a long
story short, i got a fujifilm x-t3 with two lenses and i'm loving it so far (despite the
bulk and the weight).

on technical side, i'm still using [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org){:target='_blank'}
and enjoying it a lot.

that's pretty much it for now.
