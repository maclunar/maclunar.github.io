june 2025, tarnowskie g√≥ry, poland

after enjoying winter in the south of europe (portugal and spain), we're now happily in
poland, where summer is just beginning.

last year we moved to a new house in our hometown, and it's great to finally have a garage
for the car and a small yard for the dog.

i'm currently working at lumenalta, an american consulting company, as a senior ruby developer.
it's fun to be back in a "software house" environment, being able to work on various projects.
i'm experimenting a lot with llms for code generation (mostly in cursor). it's wild how much
faster it is to implement features this way. this updates is being typed in neovim though ;)

on the camera gear front - i've traded my fuji gear for a nikon z6 mk2 with a 24-70 f/2.8 zoom.
i love the full frame sensor and the zoom gives a lot of flexibility, but it's a pig to lug around.
i've just purchased a 35/1.4 lens, which i'm excited to test on an upcoming hiking trip to diablak.

p.s. you can find history of this page on
