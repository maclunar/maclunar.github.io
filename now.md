I'm in Krak√≥w, Poland. It's winter.

I brave the horrific air quality everyday while walking my dog.

I'm working remotely with an international team since November of 2015.
Remote work has its challenges, but I enjoy it.

I'm doing my best to eat better and move more. I even started to cook a bit,
something I never liked doing.

I'm intending to spend some time adding to this site, to have a space that
would homogenise my online presence.
