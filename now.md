i'm in krak√≥w, poland. it's spring

waling the dog daily has become a real pleasure,
as summer is in the air.

i'm still working remotely with an international team.
Remote work has its challenges, but I enjoy it

i'm experimenting with intermittent fasting.
i feel good doing it, but it's not always easy to refrain from snacking.

i'm finally tweaking this space.
i've even began redirecting my domain here.
i've started to bite into jekyll and i hope to learn a lot about it.

i need to fix my bike.
