i'm in krak√≥w, poland. it's almost summer time.

almost a month ago i've started a new job in a local company,
working as a ruby on rails developer on an in-house project.
it's a big change after working remotely for a software house,
but so far i'm really enjoying it.

i haven't eaten any meat for almost a year now.
i feel healthy and i'm positive i can keep this up for the
rest of my life. if you've ever considered going this road
-- i can wholeheartedly recommend watching some of 
[earthling ed's videos](https://hooktube.com/channel/UCVRrGAcUc7cblUzOhI1KfFg){:target='_blank'}.

feeling a bit bored with vim (gasp!), i'm experimenting with
vs code at the moment. it's nice to use something else for
a little while. the mouse integration in this thing is really
impressive! also, it looks great with solarized-light theme.

the dog is doing great. he's healthy and over 3 at this point.
he also doesn't eat meat.

i need to fix my bike.
